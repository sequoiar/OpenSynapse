Open Synapse

What is Open Synapse?
Open Synapse is an Async Task Server. Basically, the server application handles communication between task routines.

What is Task Routine?
A task routine is a simple client socket application/script called by a unique name. Open Synapse delivers messages by that unique name. You can write your task routines in any language which supports network sockets.

What is Key-based Task Routine?
Open Synapse supports distributed task management. By default, server chooses one of those distributed tasks randomly but sometimes tasks may need specific selection. As in memory cache applications, key-based selection is a highly recommended distribution method.

Installation & Setup:
To run Open Synapse, you need these libraries:
- gevent (http://gevent.org)
- ujson (https://github.com/jskorpan/ultrajson)

to install:
$git clone git@github.com:MrGoodbyte/OpenSynapse.git

to run:
$python server.py

Note: You can modify PORT information in config.py file.

Example Transactions:
{“c”:”reg”, “p”:{“n”:”my-task”}}
{“c”:”reg”, “p”:{“n”:”my-key-based-task”, “k”:true}}
{“c”:”cll”, “p”:{“n”:”my-task”, “d”:{“id”:5}}}
{“c”:”cll”, “p”:{“n”:”my-key-based-task”, “d”:{“k”:”my-key”}}}
